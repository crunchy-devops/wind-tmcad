Develop a DXF-to-Point Cloud conversion class that processes the DXF file located at data/plan-masse.dxf. Implement a function to retrieve all DXF layers and allow selection of the "z value TN" layer for a dmonstation Python cript.In this lyer, ers aPoint3D coordinates are represented as DXF TEXT entities, where X and Y are positional values, and Z is stored as the text content. Additionally, provide a function to define break lines by entering Point3D IDs and store them in an appropriate Python data structure. adhere to PEP8, dockstrings, and annotations, use __all__ and __slots__, write test coverage at 80%
